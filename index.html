        With the catastrophic effects of this summer’s unprecedented wildfires still being counted, leaders from around 
        the Mediterranean – the European region most at risk from climate breakdown – have vowed to intensify their efforts to tackle 
        the challenges posed by extreme weather.
    </p>
    <p>
        A joint declaration, signed in Athens, has fired the starting shot on what is hoped will bring groundbreaking 
        change in how the neighbouring states shore up their defences against natural disasters.
    </p>

        “It’s the first time that Mediterranean countries have come together to address such an incredible common threat 
        and that’s hugely significant,” says the Greek capital’s chief heat officer, Eleni Myrivili, of the initiative.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Until now we’ve been toddlers in our response to building climate resilience through transnational collaboration,”
        she said. “What has just been agreed, in both breadth and depth, is a gamechanger.”
    </p>
    <p>
        At no other time has the spectre of climate catastrophe seemed as real across a region that in recent months has been 
        forced to deal with forest fires from the Spanish region of Andalucía to the southern reaches of Turkey. The leaders of 
        nine southern EU countries accepted that urgent and ambitious global action was now needed to create “a safe, secure, prosperous, 
        fair and sustainable future”. Collaboration at all levels – national, regional and local, boosted by civil society and the 
        private sector – was required, they said.
    </p>

        “The devastating wildfires of the summer had tragic consequences for Mediterranean countries … the climate crisis is no 
        longer a distant threat; it has landed firmly on our shores,” the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, told counterparts 
        assembled in the Greek capital.
    </p>
    <p>
        “As the danger presented by this crisis is common to all of us, so must our defences be.”

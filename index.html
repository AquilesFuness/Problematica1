        With the catastrophic effects of this summer’s unprecedented wildfires still being counted, leaders from around 
        the Mediterranean – the European region most at risk from climate breakdown – have vowed to intensify their efforts to tackle 
        the challenges posed by extreme weather.

        A joint declaration, signed in Athens, has fired the starting shot on what is hoped will bring groundbreaking 
        change in how the neighbouring states shore up their defences against natural disasters.

        “It’s the first time that Mediterranean countries have come together to address such an incredible common threat 
        and that’s hugely significant,” says the Greek capital’s chief heat officer, Eleni Myrivili, of the initiative.

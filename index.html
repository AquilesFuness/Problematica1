            With the catastrophic effects of this summer’s unprecedented wildfires still being counted, leaders from
            around
            the Mediterranean – the European region most at risk from climate breakdown – have vowed to intensify their
            efforts to tackle
            the challenges posed by extreme weather.

        A joint declaration, signed in Athens, has fired the starting shot on what is hoped will bring groundbreaking
        change in how the neighbouring states shore up their defences against natural disasters.
    </p>
    <p>
        “It’s the first time that Mediterranean countries have come together to address such an incredible common threat
        and that’s hugely significant,” says the Greek capital’s <a class="inline-link"
            href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/10/heat-athens-climate-crisis-mayor"
            data-link-name="in body link">chief heat officer</a>, Eleni Myrivili, of the initiative.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Until now we’ve been toddlers in our response to building climate resilience through transnational
        collaboration,”
        she said. “What has just been agreed, in both breadth and depth, is a gamechanger.”
    </p>
    <p>
        At no other time has the spectre of climate catastrophe seemed as real across a region that in recent months has
        been
        forced to deal with forest fires from the <a class="inline-link"
            href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/13/spain-wildfire-emergency-workers-fighting-blaze-andalucia"
            data-link-name="in body link">Spanish region of Andalucía</a> to the southern reaches of Turkey. The
        leaders of
        nine southern EU countries accepted that urgent and ambitious global action was now needed to create “a safe,
        secure, prosperous,
        fair and sustainable future”. Collaboration at all levels – national, regional and local, boosted by civil
        society and the
        private sector – was required, they said.
    </p>
    <p>
        “The devastating wildfires of the summer had tragic consequences for Mediterranean countries … the climate
        crisis is no
        longer a distant threat; it has landed firmly on our shores,” the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, told
        counterparts
        assembled in the Greek capital.
    </p>
    <p>
        “As the danger presented by this crisis is common to all of us, so must our defences be.”

        Signed late on Friday at a summit attended by the heads of France, Spain, Italy, Portugal, <a
            class="inline-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/cyprus" data-component="auto-linked-tag"
            data-link-name="in body link">Cyprus</a>, Malta,
        Slovenia and Croatia,
        the Athens Declaration contains pledges in key areas of the climate crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
        Biodiversity, forest management, the marine environment and civil protection, prevention and preparedness were
        singled out by
        participants who also called for closer integration of climate-change policies across Europe and further
        cooperation within
        the EU’s transnational disaster response mechanism. Experts and technologies critical for ecosystem recovery
        should be exchanged,
        they said, given the longer, more frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, floods and forest fires the region
        was facing.
    </p>
    <p>
        The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, who was also present, called the climate initiative
        “the right move at the right time”. “We all see that climate change is heavily affecting the Mediterranean
        region,” she said.
        “And we need to find solutions and we can offer solutions.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Athens is by far the hottest metropolis in mainland Europe, with predictions it could become the continent’s
        first uninhabitable
        capital city if temperatures keep rising.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mitsotakis’s centre-right government endured fierce criticism for its handling of fires that erupted as record
        heatwaves transformed
        bone-dry terrain into what the leader described as a “powder keg”. The mercury hit an unprecedented 47.1C
        (116.8F) with temperatures
        exceeding 42C for several days in July and August forcing mass evacuations as thousands of hectares of virgin
        forest and farmland
        were consumed by flames.
    </p>
    <p>
        On Athens’ northern outskirts, the island of Evia and the southern Peloponnese, <a class="inline-link"
            href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/07/apocalyptic-scenes-hit-greece-as-athens-besieged-by-fire"
            data-link-name="in body link">homes were razed and animals killed in infernos fanned by gale-force winds
            that raged for days</a>. With his administration put on the defensive, the Greek prime
        minister has sought
        to place the climate crisis at the centre of his agenda, appointing a minister, Christos Stylianides, who will
        deal exclusively
        with the climate crisis while assuming a pioneering role in galvanising regional support to confront the
        problem.
    </p>
    <p>
        But Myrivili – Europe’s first urban heat officer, tasked with addressing the scorching heat that cities such as
        the Greek capital
        are expected to experience in the coming years – said the manifesto’s absence of any mention of the role of
        cities in fighting
        climate breakdown was a “shocking” oversight. She argued the absence of cities from the declaration “betrays the
        lack of
        coordination that still exists between national government policies and municipal policies regarding climate
        change.
        Urban centres and their communities are an integral part of any solution.”
